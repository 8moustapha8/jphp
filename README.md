JPHP - an implementation of PHP
===============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jphp-compiler/jphp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jphp-compiler/jphp) [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/dim-s/maven/jphp-compiler/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/dim-s/maven/jphp-compiler/_latestVersion) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/jphp-docs/badge/?version=latest)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/jphp-docs/?badge=latest)

JPHP is a new implementation for PHP which uses the Java VM. It supports many features of the PHP language (5.6+).

How does it work? JPHP is a compiler like `javac`, it compiles php sources to JVM bytecode and then
can execute the result on the Java VM.

### Goals

JPHP is not a replacement for the Zend PHP engine or Facebook HHVM. We donâ€™t plan to implement the zend runtime libraries (e.g. Curl, PRCE, etc.) for JPHP.

Our project started in October 2013. There were a few reasons for that:

1. Ability to use java libraries in PHP
2. Upgrading performance via JIT and JVM
3. Replacing the ugly runtime library of Zend PHP with a better runtime library.
4. Using the PHP language not only on the web
5. Also: unicode for strings and threads

### Features

+ JIT (1x - 10x faster PHP 5.5), Optimizer (constant expressions, inline functions, etc.)
+ Using java libraries and classes in PHP code.
+ Unicode for strings (UTF-16, like in Java)
+ Threading, Sockets, Environment architecture (like sandbox objects in runkit zend extension).
+ GUI (based on Swing, improved - more flexible layouts)
+ Embedded cache system for classes and functions
+ Optional Hot Reloading for classes and functions
+ Ability to use on **Android** OS

**What JPHP does not yet support?**

+ Importing namespaced functions (php 5.6)
